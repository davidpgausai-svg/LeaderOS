Let’s treat Porter’s Five Forces as a **Strategy → Projects → Actions engine** inside your platform, not just a textbook framework.

---

## 1. Where Porter’s Five Forces Lives in Your Stack

**Purpose in your software:**
Porter’s Five Forces should sit in the **External Analysis / Competitive Landscape** area and feed directly into:

* **Strategic Priorities** (e.g., “Defend market share in core segments”)
* **Projects / Initiatives** (e.g., “Launch bundled offer for mid-market customers”)
* **Actionable Outcomes** (owner, timeline, KPIs)

**High-level workflow in your app:**

1. **Fill** – Capture structured inputs for each force (ratings, narrative, evidence).
2. **Generate insights** – Summarize advantages, vulnerabilities, and pressure points.
3. **Prioritize responses** – Convert the top threats/opportunities into:

   * Objectives (Strategy Level)
   * Projects (Portfolio Level)
   * Action Items (Execution Level)

I’ll lay this out force by force, with **what the CSO thinks about** and **what your app should capture**.

## 2. Threat of New Entrants

### What it means

How easy is it for new players to enter your market and erode your margins / share?

### Dimensions to capture in the tool

Create fields in your software to assess:

* **Capital requirements** (High / Medium / Low)
* **Regulatory / compliance barriers**
* **Switching costs for customers**
* **Brand / trust and reputation barriers**
* **Access to distribution channels**
* **Access to technology / data / IP**
* **Network effects / ecosystem lock-in**

### Diagnostic prompts for users (inside your app)

* “How much capital would a credible new competitor need to match our offering?”
* “What regulations, licensing, or certifications constrain entry?”
* “How easy is it for customers to try a new competitor (time, risk, data migration)?”
* “How strong are our brand and trust advantages vs. a new name in the space?”
* “Could a big tech / adjacent player enter quickly with their existing capabilities?”

### Rating rubric (for software)

**Threat of New Entrants Score (1–5):**

* **1 – Very Low:** High capital + high regulation + strong switching costs + strong brand.
* **3 – Moderate:** Some barriers, but new digital players can still enter within 12–24 months.
* **5 – Very High:** Low capital, low regulation, customers can switch easily.

Your app:

* One **numeric field (1–5)**
* One **summary statement** (auto-generated from responses, e.g., “New entrants are a moderate risk driven by low switching costs and limited regulatory barriers.”)

### Strategic levers → Projects → Actions

If **threat is high**, typical CSO responses:

* **Deepen switching costs**

  * Project: “Implement workspace templates + embedded historical data to lock in workflows.”
  * Actions: Migrate top 20 customers to new template library; create “your data history” dashboards.

* **Strengthen brand and ecosystem**

  * Project: “Launch ‘Certified Strategy Partner’ program.”
  * Actions: Build certification curriculum; recruit 10 launch partners.

* **Raise structural barriers**

  * Project: “Negotiate exclusive / long-term data or channel partnerships.”
  * Actions: Identify top 3 potential partners; assign owner; open negotiations.

In your platform, each identified lever becomes:
**Insight → Strategic Priority → Project Card → Action Items with owners + dates.**

---

## 3. Supplier Power

### What it means

How much leverage do your key suppliers (infrastructure, data, platforms, talent pools, etc.) have over your economics and capabilities?

### Dimensions to capture

* **Concentration of suppliers** (few vs many)
* **Uniqueness of their input** (commodity vs specialized)
* **Switching costs for you**
* **Share of your cost structure** (how much they eat into margins)
* **Risk of vertical integration** (supplier moving downstream into your market)
* **Dependency on specific tech platforms (e.g., cloud, LLM vendors, marketplaces)**

### Diagnostic prompts

* “Where are we single-threaded on critical suppliers (tech, data, channels, talent)?”
* “What would it take to switch to an alternative provider?”
* “Which suppliers could plausibly move into our space and compete with us?”
* “How often and how aggressively do key suppliers raise prices or change terms?”

### Rating rubric

**Supplier Power Score (1–5):**

* **1 – Very Low:** Many alternatives, low switching costs, no supplier concentration.
* **3 – Moderate:** Some dependency on a few key vendors but alternatives exist.
* **5 – Very High:** One or two critical suppliers; switching is extremely difficult/costly.

### Strategic levers → Projects → Actions

If **supplier power is high**, responses might include:

* **Diversify suppliers / dual-source strategy**

  * Project: “Create multi-vendor architecture for hosting / data / AI.”
  * Actions: Evaluate 2nd vendor; pilot migration of one module.

* **Backward integration / building internal capabilities**

  * Project: “Internalize core analytics / data processing capability.”
  * Actions: Hire lead data engineer; scope MVP internal service.

* **Negotiate strategic partnerships**

  * Project: “Strategic supplier agreements with volume discounts.”
  * Actions: Build 3-year volume forecast; negotiate new terms.

Your app converts “High Supplier Power in AI Infrastructure” into a **named strategic risk**, linked to a **Project** with **mitigation tasks** and **risk owner**.

## 4. Buyer Power

### What it means

How much influence do customers have over pricing, terms, and product direction?

### Dimensions to capture

* **Number of buyers vs you** (concentration)
* **Average contract size / deal importance to you**
* **Standardization of your product** (commodity vs differentiated)
* **Price sensitivity of customers**
* **Switching costs and lock-in**
* **Availability of alternatives**
* **Information symmetry** (how much they know about competitors’ offers and your economics)

### Diagnostic prompts

* “Do a small number of accounts represent a large share of our revenue?”
* “Can buyers play us against competitors to drive down price?”
* “How often do customers demand discounts, custom terms, or bespoke features?”
* “If we raised prices 10%, what would likely happen?”

### Rating rubric

**Buyer Power Score (1–5):**

* **1 – Very Low:** Many buyers, low concentration, differentiated value, low price sensitivity.
* **3 – Moderate:** Mix of small and large buyers; some negotiation but manageable.
* **5 – Very High:** Few big accounts with heavy negotiation leverage and alternatives.

### Strategic levers → Projects → Actions

If **buyer power is high**, responses include:

* **Increase differentiation / perceived value**

  * Project: “Launch ‘Strategy OS’ bundle: platform + advisory + templates.”
  * Actions: Design bundle; pilot with 5 key accounts.

* **Reduce revenue concentration**

  * Project: “Mid-market expansion program.”
  * Actions: Define ideal customer profile; outbound campaign; adjust pricing tiers.

* **Create switching costs / embed deeply**

  * Project: “Embed customer’s KPI framework and org structure in the app.”
  * Actions: Build onboarding playbook; automate import of KPIs / org data.

In your tool, each **high-risk buyer power insight** converts into a **revenue risk initiative** with explicit **success metrics** (e.g., “Top-3 accounts < 25% of ARR by FY+2”).

## 5. Threat of Substitutes

### What it means

Threat not from direct competitors, but from alternate ways customers can solve the same problem.

For your Strategic Planning Software, substitutes might be:

* Excel / PowerPoint / Notion / generic project tools
* Consultants with custom slideware
* Homegrown internal tools

### Dimensions to capture

* **Ease of switching to the substitute**
* **Performance / perceived quality vs you**
* **Relative price / total cost of ownership**
* **Customer habits and inertia**
* **Functional overlap with your core value proposition**

### Diagnostic prompts

* “What are customers using today instead of us?”
* “What would they switch to if we disappeared tomorrow?”
* “Are there ‘good enough’ low-cost tools that can meet 70% of the need?”
* “Do substitutes integrate better into their existing tech stack or workflows?”

### Rating rubric

**Threat of Substitutes Score (1–5):**

* **1 – Very Low:** Your solution is uniquely capable; substitutes are clearly inferior.
* **3 – Moderate:** Substitutes exist and are good enough for some segments.
* **5 – Very High:** Low-cost, widely adopted tools can do most of the job.

### Strategic levers → Projects → Actions

If **substitute threat is high**, responses:

* **Out-execute substitutes on outcomes, not features**

  * Project: “Outcome-based onboarding and playbooks (Strategy → Projects → Outcomes).”
  * Actions: Build 3 “playbook journeys” (e.g., Annual Plan, OKR rollout, Portfolio reset).

* **Integrate with substitutes instead of just competing**

  * Project: “Deep integrations with Excel / Power BI / Notion.”
  * Actions: Build export/import and two-way sync; publish templates.

* **Reposition as a system-of-record / operating system**

  * Project: “Messaging reposition: from ‘tool’ to ‘Strategy Operating System.’”
  * Actions: Update website, decks, and in-app language.

In your platform, “High threat from Excel + basic PM tools” yields **clear messaging / integration projects** linked to **NPS, expansion, and win-rate metrics.**

## 6. Competitive Rivalry

### What it means

The intensity of competition among existing players.

### Dimensions to capture

* **Number of competitors and their relative size**
* **Industry growth rate** (room to grow vs zero-sum)
* **Degree of differentiation vs commoditization**
* **Fixed vs variable cost structure (drives price wars)**
* **Frequency of price discounting / promotions**
* **Customer switching frequency / churn**
* **Exit barriers (sunk costs, long-term contracts, regulatory constraints)**

### Diagnostic prompts

* “How many serious competitors target the same segment?”
* “Are deals frequently won/lost on price?”
* “How aggressively do competitors release features or undercut pricing?”
* “Are we seeing consolidation or fragmentation in our space?”

### Rating rubric

**Competitive Rivalry Score (1–5):**

* **1 – Very Low:** Few competitors, clear differentiation, healthy margins.
* **3 – Moderate:** Several players; competition on product + service + price.
* **5 – Very High:** Many players; frequent price wars; high churn.

### Strategic levers → Projects → Actions

For **high rivalry**, responses:

* **Sharpen differentiation / category design**

  * Project: “Define and own the ‘Strategy-to-Action OS’ category.”
  * Actions: Category narrative; thought leadership series; reference customer case studies.

* **Customer success as a moat**

  * Project: “Strategy Adoption and Outcomes Team.”
  * Actions: Build playbooks, QBR templates, outcome dashboards.

* **Focused segmentation**

  * Project: “Double down on 2–3 core verticals where we truly win.”
  * Actions: Vertical-specific template libraries; vertical GTM campaigns.

Your app:
Every **force score and narrative** should drive **which segments to prioritize**, **where to fight / avoid**, and **which battles to walk away from.**

## 7. Strategic Levers Summary (What Your Software Should Surface)

After all five forces are filled out, your platform should:

1. **Compute a Force Profile**

   * Display each force on a **1–5 pressure scale**.
   * Show a spider/radar chart: which forces are most threatening?

2. **Generate Insight Statements** (AI/logic)

   * Example:

     * “New Entrants: Moderate–High (4/5) due to low switching costs and rising no/low-code tools.”
     * “Substitutes: High (5/5) – spreadsheets and generic PM tools remain ‘good enough’ for many organizations.”

3. **Convert to Strategic Priorities**

   * Each high-pressure force maps to 1–3 **Strategic Priorities** (e.g., “Increase lock-in via integrated KPIs and governance workflows.”)

4. **Cascade to Projects and Actions**

   * For each priority, create:

     * **Project Name**
     * **Owner**
     * **Timeline**
     * **Success Metrics** (e.g., “Reduce revenue from top 3 customers from 40% → 25% in 24 months.”)
     * **Dependencies / Risks** (e.g., “Requires API access from suppliers.”)

5. **Track Outcomes**

   * Tie each project to:

     * **Leading indicators** (adoption, engagement, NPS)
     * **Lagging indicators** (renewals, expansion, margin, market share where measurable)

## 8. Embedded Workflow in Your Strategy → Projects → Actions OS

Here’s how I’d design the native workflow as a CSO using your tool:

1. **Create a “Five Forces Assessment” record** for a market / segment.
2. **Facilitate a strategy workshop** where leaders collaboratively fill in:

   * Ratings (1–5)
   * Narrative explanations
   * Evidence / links / attachments
3. **Use the app to auto-generate an “Insight Summary”**

   * Top 5 risk/opportunity statements
   * Ranked by impact and urgency
4. **Promote the top insights to Strategic Priorities**

   * One click: “Promote to Priority”
5. **For each Priority, spawn Projects**

   * Standard project template: problem, hypothesis, scope, owner, timeline, KPIs.
6. **Break Projects into Action Items**

   * Sequenced tasks with owners, due dates, and status.
7. **Monitor in a Portfolio Dashboard**

   * View: Which projects are directly responding to which competitive forces?
   * Ensure every major risk has at least one active strategic initiative attached.
