You said workstreams will be a "Workstreams page accessible from the sidebar." That contradicts the decision we landed on — workstreams connect to your existing Strategies, meaning they're Projects under a Strategy, not a standalone module. If you add a separate Workstreams sidebar section, you've built the standalone module we specifically decided against.
Here's how to reconcile this: the Workstreams page should be a view within your existing Strategy/Project structure, not a new top-level navigation item. When a user clicks into an ERP Strategy, they see its workstreams (which are Projects) with the special views you described — matrix view, phase gate view, executive rollup. The views are what's new, not the navigation destination.
If your app architecture makes that difficult and you truly need a sidebar entry, make it a shortcut that navigates to the ERP Strategy's project list with the workstream views pre-applied — not a separate data space.
On the strategyId being optional
Making strategyId optional on workstreams means you're allowing disconnected workstreams, which is the exact failure mode we discussed. Make it required. Every workstream must belong to a Strategy. If an administrator isn't ready to link to a Strategy yet, they aren't ready to create workstreams — they need the Strategy first. That's the correct sequencing anyway.
On the five-table model
The five tables are right, but clarify the relationship between workstream_tasks and your existing Actions table. You have two options:
Option 1: workstream_tasks IS your existing Actions table with added columns (phase_id, is_milestone, milestone_type, duration_days, is_critical). This is better. You get the existing dependency logic, status tracking, assignments, and UI for free. Workstream tasks are just Actions with ERP-specific metadata.
Option 2: workstream_tasks is a separate table. This means you're maintaining two task systems — your existing Actions and a parallel workstream task tracker. Users will ask "do I put this in Actions or in workstream tasks?" and the answer will never be clear.
Go with Option 1. Extend Actions rather than duplicating them. The phase_id and milestone fields become nullable columns that are only populated when an Action belongs to a workstream-linked Project.
On server-side calculations
RAG status and milestone completion logic should be server-side, agreed. Be careful with critical path (CPM) though — it requires a full dependency graph traversal across potentially thousands of tasks. Two considerations:
Compute on demand, cache aggressively. Don't recalculate CPM on every page load. Recalculate when a dependency or date changes, store the is_critical flag on each task, and serve the cached value. Invalidate when any task in the dependency chain is updated.
Scope CPM to a single Strategy. Don't run it across the entire database. The critical path is only meaningful within one program's dependency graph.
On seed data timing
You said seed data inserts "when an organization creates its first workstream setup." Be more specific about the trigger. I'd recommend: when an administrator clicks "Create ERP Program" (or activates the template), the system creates the Strategy, the 10 workstream Projects under it, the 7 phase values, and the program-level gate milestones inside the Program Management workstream. All in one transaction. Don't trickle them in — the structure only makes sense as a complete set.
What's missing from the plan
Gate criteria. You have the gate_criteria table, which is good. Make sure the UI for program-level milestone Actions includes a checklist of criteria that must all be marked is_met = TRUE before the milestone can be completed. This is the qualitative layer that prevents someone from marking "PG1: Design Phase Exit" as done just because all tasks show 100% — the Steering Committee approval, the signed FDDs, the supervisory org sign-off all need explicit confirmation.
The "contributes to" linkage. We discussed tagging workstream Projects with which Priorities they contribute to (Primary vs. Supporting). That's not in your five-table model. Either add a workstream_priorities join table or plan to handle it with your existing tagging system.
Filtering by phase across workstreams. Your four views are good, but make sure the matrix view can be filtered to a single phase — "show me all workstreams' status in the Test phase only." That's the view the PMO will use in the weekly phase-gate readiness meeting.
Summary of changes

Not a new sidebar section — a view within your existing Strategy structure
strategyId required, not optional
Extend your existing Actions table instead of creating a parallel workstream_tasks table
Cache CPM results, recompute on dependency/date changes only
Seed all data in one transaction on template activation
Add priority linkage to the data model
Ensure gate criteria checklist blocks milestone completion in the UI
