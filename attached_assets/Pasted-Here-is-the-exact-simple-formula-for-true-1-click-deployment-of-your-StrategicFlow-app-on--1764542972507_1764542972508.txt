Here is the **exact, simple formula** for true **1-click deployment** of your StrategicFlow app on **DigitalOcean App Platform**, using the Campfire-style SQLite + Docker setup.

This is the SAME pattern used by Once.com/Campfire, adapted for your stack.

---

# ⭐ **1-Click Deployment = Three Components**

To enable *true* 1-click deployment, you need **ONLY THREE things**:

---

## ✅ **1. A public GitHub repo**

Your StrategicFlow project must be pushed to GitHub.

Example:

```
https://github.com/YOURNAME/strategicflow
```

---

## ✅ **2. A `.do/app.yaml` file inside the repo**

DigitalOcean reads this file automatically to configure everything.

Your project already uses something like:

```
/.do/app.yaml
```

This tells DO:

* what port to use
* how to build
* how to run
* how to mount your SQLite `/data` volume
* what env vars to set

This is what turns your repo into a **deployable app**.

---

## ✅ **3. A special DigitalOcean link that auto-builds the repo**

This is the magic part.

DigitalOcean has a hidden feature:

```
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=GITHUB_URL
```

Example (replace YOURNAME):

```
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/YOURNAME/strategicflow
```

When someone clicks this link:

### 🚀 DigitalOcean automatically:

* clones your repo
* reads `.do/app.yaml`
* builds Docker container
* mounts SQLite volume
* sets ENV vars
* provisions HTTPS
* deploys the app

This is the **official “Deploy to DO” button** behind the scenes.

---

# ⭐ **What the Customer Sees (Non-Technical Flow)**

Your non-technical customer clicks:

➡️ **[https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/YOURNAME/strategicflow](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/YOURNAME/strategicflow)**

Then:

### **Step 1 — DO auto-imports everything**

No config needed.

### **Step 2 — Customer adds only ONE environment variable:**

```
JWT_SECRET = something-random
```

### **Step 3 — They click Deploy**

In **90 seconds**, their app is live.

### **Step 4 — Done**

They have their own private StrategicFlow installation.

---

# ⭐ **Recommended: Add a “Deploy to DigitalOcean” Badge**

Inside your README.md:

```
[![Deploy to DO](https://www.digitalocean.com/_next/static/media/deploy-do-btn.5ea9f927.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/YOURNAME/strategicflow)
```

This gives your customers a real button:

### ➡️ **Deploy to DigitalOcean**

And they’re off.

---

# ⭐ **Your App.yaml Must Support One-Click**

Make sure your `.do/app.yaml` contains:

* persistent SQLite volume
* port 3000
* build + run commands
* env var definition

Example (simplified):

```yaml
name: strategicflow
services:
  - name: app
    github:
      repo: YOURNAME/strategicflow
      branch: main
    http_port: 3000
    envs:
      - key: JWT_SECRET
        scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
    build_command: "npm install && npm run build"
    run_command: "npm start"
    volumes:
      - name: sqlite-data
        mount_path: /data

volumes:
  - name: sqlite-data
```

This gives true 1-click deployability.

---

# ⭐ FINAL RESULT

With:

1. **GitHub repo**
2. **.do/app.yaml**
3. **DigitalOcean 1-click URL**

You get:

### 🔥 *True, frictionless, Campfire-style “1 Click Deployment”*

Your customers can deploy without ever touching:

* Docker
* Servers
* Databases
* SSH
* Terminals
* Hosting configuration

They click.
DO deploys.
They own their app.
